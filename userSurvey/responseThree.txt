Seems like the app gives cost values between routers and how to get from
one to the other. Might be helpful to add a description of what it's
doing for a better learning experience. Also you can add working links
to dead nodes, not sure if this supposed to be allowed. Instead of using
dest, hop, and cst, it would be an easier learning experience to read
full words for what they represent.
