I must say I'm very impressed you got this done so quickly, you must be a react wizard. I have a few comments. 

Regarding the front end, the Messaging order section takes too much space and is a tad off-putting, maybe make the rectangle smaller or divide them into smaller squares. The application doesn't seem to handle window adjustment (making the window small) very well, see screenshot. 

The sim works great from what I can see, would be useful for testing configuration and lectures but lacks some sort of exercise for someone who new to routers sim. Maybe adding a problem set or a game mode showing how important rules like Split Horizon and Forced update are. This could give this much more purpose and would be useful for studying for exams
